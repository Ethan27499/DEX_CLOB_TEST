                              Ngày: 25/08/2025
================================================================================

I. TÓM TẮT EXECUTIVE
===================

Target: Implement Orbital-style multi-asset AMM cho stablecoin trading
Timeline: 6-12 tháng development
Budget: $3.5-14.5M total funding needed
Success Rate: 70% feasible với proper execution
Risk Level: TRUNG BÌNH - CAO

Key Opportunity:
- Stablecoin volume: $2.3T/tháng và đang explode
- Paradigm Orbital chỉ mới concept, chưa implementation
- First-mover advantage trong next-gen AMM
- Existing infrastructure (CLOB + Oracle) làm foundation

II. MARKET ANALYSIS
===================

A. Current Problems:
- Uniswap: Fragmented liquidity (USDC/DAI, USDC/USDT separate pools)
- Curve: Depeg risk affects entire pool
- High slippage do thanh khoản spread across multiple venues
- Poor UX with multi-hop swaps

B. Market Size:
- Daily volume USDT-USDC: $300-500M on Ethereum only
- New stablecoins: PayPal PYUSD, Stripe USDB entering
- US regulatory clarity driving adoption
- Total stablecoin trading: $2.3T monthly

C. Competitive Landscape:
- Uniswap V2/V3: Market leader nhưng có limitations
- Curve Finance: Specialized cho stables nhưng risky
- Balancer: Complex, low adoption
- Orbital: Concept only, no implementation timeline

III. TECHNICAL CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS
=====================================

A. CORE MATH PROBLEMS:

1. Multi-Asset Invariant Function
--------------------------------
Problem: Find f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) = k for n stablecoins
Current: x * y = k (2 assets) or Curve's amplified constant sum
Needed: Stable prices trong range [0.99, 1.01] cho all assets

Proposed Solution:
- Hybrid constant product + constant sum
- Dynamic amplification based on asset correlations
- Piecewise functions cho different price ranges

2. Concentrated Liquidity Math
-----------------------------
Problem: Uniswap V3 style ranges cho multi-asset
Current: 2D price ranges [Pa, Pb]
Needed: n-dimensional liquidity distribution

Proposed Solution:
- Price range matrix cho each asset pair
- Weighted liquidity allocation
- Dynamic range adjustment based on volatility

3. Optimal Routing Algorithm
---------------------------
Problem: Tìm best swap path trong multi-asset pool
Complexity: n! possible routes for n assets
Real-time requirement: <100ms response

Proposed Solution:
- Dynamic programming approach
- Pre-computed routing tables
- Machine learning optimization

B. RISK MANAGEMENT:

1. Depeg Detection System
------------------------
Requirements:
- Real-time monitoring (<30 seconds detection)
- False positive rate <1%
- Integration với oracle system
- Automatic isolation triggers

Algorithm:
```
if (abs(oracle_price - 1.0) > 0.02 && 
    volume_weighted_price deviation > 0.015 &&
    duration > 300 seconds) {
    trigger_isolation(asset);
}
```

2. Asset Isolation Mechanism
---------------------------
Process:
- Pause new swaps involving depegged asset
- Migrate existing LP positions
- Recalculate pool mathematics
- Maintain other assets trading normally

Technical:
- Emergency pause functions
- LP position migration contracts
- State rollback capabilities

C. GAS OPTIMIZATION:

Current Estimates:
- Uniswap V2: ~60K gas per swap
- Uniswap V3: ~120K gas per swap
